# Accessibility Improvements Summary
This week, the goal was to make a website accessible. The task involved choosing a previous project and enhancing its accessibility or starting a new one, with a focus on meeting accessibility guidelines, achieving a Lighthouse score of at least 95, using semantic HTML elements, providing alt attributes for all images, and maintaining sufficient contrast.

I chose to improve my previous project, "news site." After analyzing it in Lighthouse, I adjusted the contrast on one of my buttons. I removed a blinking button as it could be distracting for some individuals. I also restructured my `<ul>` list to contain `<li>` elements, added a `lang` attribute in the HTML code, and tested the website's usability by navigating with the keyboard and using voice control on my computer.
